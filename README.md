# Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

In real world spending enough time on a proper EDA to fully understand your dataset is a key part of any good data science project. As a rule of thumb, you probably will spend 80% of your time in data preparation and exploration and only 20% in actual machine learning modeling.

## Investigation of structure, quality and content

Overall, the EDA approach is very iterative. At the end of your investigation you might discover something that will require you to redo everything once more. That is normal! But to impose at least a little bit of structure, I propose the following structure for your investigations:

1. Structure investigation: Exploring the general shape of the dataset, as well as the data types of your features.

2. Quality investigation: Get a feeling for the general quality of the dataset, with regards to duplicates, missing values and unwanted entries.

3. Content investigation: Once thestructure and quality of the dataset is understood, we can go ahead and perform a more in-depth exploration on the features values and look at how different features relates to each other.
